themeDark-smilem
==========

The themeDark-smilem theme is a modification of themeDark-Jerware by Arduino forum user smilem with the intention of being easier to read. It was originally released at http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=124543.msg1497522#msg1497522.

Due to changes in the Arduino IDE, the original theme files caused the IDE to no longer start. I have updated the theme to work with the current Arduino IDE version(1.6.11) and changed the current line highlight, selection, double quoted string, preprocessor, and console warning/error colors to improve usability.
