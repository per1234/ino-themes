themeDark-Jerware
==========

The themeDark-Jerware theme is a modification of the ArduOpen theme by Arduino forum user Jerware. It was originally released at http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=124543.msg936062#msg936062.

Due to changes in the Arduino IDE, the original theme files caused the IDE to no longer start. I have updated the theme to work with the current Arduino IDE version(1.6.11) and changed the current line highlight and operator colors to improve usability.
